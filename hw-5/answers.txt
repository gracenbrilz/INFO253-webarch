• What HTTP command is used to make the http://127.0.0.1:5000/home resource respond with your full name (including spaces), the title of the page should be the full title of this class.

	I found 'name' in app.py and replaces that key-value pair with my name, using %20 to add a space:

	GET /home?name=Gracen%20Brilmyer HTTP/1.1
	Host:localhost


• Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/redirect. Note how it redirects you to ischool.berkeley.edu. You can change this using a PUT or a POST request.
• Use a PUT request to change the redirect target of http://127.0.0.1:5000/redirect from ischool.berkeley.edu to another location

	Code:

		PUT /redirect HTTP/1.1
		Host: localhost

		Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

		location=http://www.google.com
